Project Description: School Pick-up & Drop-off System

The School Pick-up & Drop-off System is designed to streamline the vehicle entry process and enhance security at Sekolah Menengah Jujutsu. The project comprises three key modules:

1. **Car Entry System:**
   - Utilizes an RFID reader at the school gate to read stickers on parents' cars.
   - Maintains an array of authorized car IDs for entry.
   - Notifies users whether their car is registered or unauthorized.

2. **Countdown System:**
   - Prompts users to indicate whether their car is parked.
   - Initiates a countdown if the car is parked, simulating a time-limited parking scenario.
   - Raises an alarm message when the countdown reaches zero, prompting users to exit the parking lot.

3. **Display Student ID:**
   - Integrates with the existing system to display student IDs on an LED-like interface.
   - Flags an unauthorized access message if the student is not registered.

The combined system ensures efficient and secure entry for registered vehicles, enforces parking compliance, and enhances monitoring of student access. The modular design allows for easy integration of additional features and supports the school's overall safety and administration efforts.
